## 🧠 Models Implemented

| Model                  | Description                                                        |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linear Regression      | Simple baseline model that fits a straight line                    |
| Polynomial Regression  | Captures non-linear patterns by transforming features              |

## 🗃️ Dataset

The dataset used is the 📦 California Housing Dataset from `sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing`. It includes:

- 📍 Location-based features (Latitude, Longitude)
- 🧍 Population, Households, Median Income
- 🏡 Housing Age, Rooms per Household
- 🎯 Target: Median House Value

---

## 📊 Visualizations

Every model section includes:

- ✅ Actual vs. Predicted Plot
- 📉 Residual Distribution
- 🧮 Feature Importance (if available)

All plots are styled using Seaborn and Matplotlib with clear titles and labeled axes.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or JupyterLab.
2. Ensure the files:
   - california_processed.csv
   - california_target.csv
   are available in the same directory.
3. Run the notebook section-by-section to train and evaluate each model.

---

## 🧰 Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
---

## 📷 Sample Output

Here are a few snapshots of the visualizations included:

- 📈 Actual vs. Predicted:
  Shows how well the model predictions align with the true values.

- 📉 Residual Distribution:
  Helps identify bias or skew in the errors.

- 🧮 Feature Importance:
  Visual ranking of which features matter most to the model.

## 💡 Insights & Observations

- 🔹 Median Income is consistently the most important feature in most models.
- 🔹 Linear models work decently but underperform on non-linear data patterns.
- 🔹 Ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting show superior performance and generalization.
- 🔹 Lasso can be used to reduce dimensionality by driving coefficients to zero.

## 🛠️ Customization

Want to tweak this project for your own dataset?

🔧 Just follow these steps:

1. Replace the data loading section with your own dataset.
2. Use the preprocessing pipeline to scale or encode new features.
3. Reuse the model training + evaluation blocks.
4. Update visualizations and metric names if the target variable changes.

The structure is generic enough to handle most regression problems.

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- 🔍 Cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning
- 🧠 Add XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM
- 📈 Add SHAP/Permutations for model explainability
- 🗺️ Create a dashboard with Streamlit or Gradio
- 🌐 Deploy as a web service for real-time predictions
